					 <p id="tribute-info">David Gilmour and Roger 'Syd' Barrett met as children in Cambridge, UK, and later began playing guitar together. In 1965 Syd joined Roger Waters, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason to form Pink Floyd, while David continued playing with a succession of his own bands. In 1968 David was asked to augment the Pink Floyd line up as the singer and guitarist, only for Syd to leave the group five gigs later. David's guitar playing, singing and song writing became major factors of Pink Floyd's worldwide success, including his distinctive vocals and guitar playing on The Dark Side Of The Moon, the third most successful album of all time.</p>
